# Hello, I'm Laura Valentina!**ðŸ‘‹**

I am a student of **Systems Engineering** at the **Universidad del Valle**, in my personal aspect I consider myself a lover of music and dance, a very nice person and full of energy. 
In my area of work I have always stood out for my good *customer service* and ***teamwork.***
I consider myself capable of proposing solutions to small and large scale problems. 
And at this point in my career I want to focus on **Front-End Web Development**, start with my basic knowledge and learn from them in the process.
